        <p class="c1">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (ISO: Mōhanadāsa Karamacaṁda Gāṁdhī;[c] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian
        lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful
        campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the
        world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in
        1914, is now used throughout the world.</p>
        <p class="c2">Lakshmibai Newalkar, the Rani of Jhansi or Jhansi ki Rani widely known as Rani Lakshmibai (pronunciation born
        Manikarnika Tambe; 19 November 1828 — 18 June 1858),[1][2] was the Maharani consort of the princely state of Jhansi in
        the Maratha Empire from 1843 to 1853 by marriage to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. She was one of the leading figures
        in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, who became a national hero and symbol of resistance to the British rule in India for
        Indian nationalists.</p>
